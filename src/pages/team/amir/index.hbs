      title: Varför jobbar du med teknik?
      position: left
      content: "I think it started when I played video games at a very young age on NES’s Nintendo Family Computer and I became good at Mario Bros 2. Then eventually by means of formal education turned into mathematics and algorithms and that’s where everybody starts, I guess. I am very interested to solve problems, I guess I enjoy solving puzzles. The computer world is now as vast as the field of medicine has ever been, so I guess computer scientists are the new-age doctors. Like doctors, we like solving complex problems and helping people achieving a higher quality of life, in a different manner and style of course."
