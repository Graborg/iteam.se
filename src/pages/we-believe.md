# We believe

What we do is not just a job — it’s a passion. We constantly vet our clients and assignments to ensure that we hold true to our core values; that everything we do should:

* Be fun
* Produce value
* Result in something good

This means that we don’t focus on billable hours. If we can produce more value in shorter time by fixing some part of the working environment — be it through improving the process, tools or the organization, we will not only suggest it — we will demand it. Waste is the nemisis of progress.
