# Passionate programmers, UX specialists and cat herders

Do you love programming? Do you find bad UX offensive? Are you deeply frustrated by wasteful processes and decisions? Then you might just enjoy working with us. We donâ€™t believe in fixed roles but in teams of strong, independent professionals. That said, we do employ people who describe themselves as developers, UX designers, business analysts and project managers. If you think you can contribute to our mission of transforming the way we produce, consume and enjoy, please give us a call!
