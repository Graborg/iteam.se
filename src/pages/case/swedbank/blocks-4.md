### A culture of learning

As a support and back-bone for the development of a new digital platform, extending outside of the realms of the internet bank, we helped founding the FDP Academy. This is an initiative to teach and mentor developers at Swedbank in the technology, insights and learnings of the new platform initiative. Iteam has helped form the contents of the program as well as teaching the first generations of academy students. The idea is to create a sustainable system of constant learning and improvement, where graduates become the mentors who teach the next generation.
