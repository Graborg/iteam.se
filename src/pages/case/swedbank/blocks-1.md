### A culture of improvement

We first met Swedbank at a Meetup. They expressed a need to increase their agility and shorten their time-to-market for new services. We had done just that, for a while. So, we put a team there with the explicit mission of not just delivering code but also culture. After working with a waterfall(-ish) process and a hugely complicated governance process for a long time, change is hard to achieve. But we did it together. The first result of this way of working was the new internet bank [my.swedbank.se](my.swedbank.se).
