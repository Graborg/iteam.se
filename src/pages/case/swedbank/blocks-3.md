### Agile colleagues

Like many enterprises, Swedbank works with Agile coaches to develop and improve their processes. This is not the niche we filled. Instead we joined the teams and participated in the daily production. We worked with the Product Owners, Project Managers and Scrum Masters to help them solve their daily challenges. We pair programmed, mentored and built tools like code generators to help raise the quality of code and tests. The first implementation of the first product released under the new process is released but the work to evolve the organization continues.
