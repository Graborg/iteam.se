We have been working with Telenor since before the Vimla! brand was even set. Developing both methodology, business idea and product. It’s a close collaboration between Vimla!, us, and their members to build the best cell phone service possible. It’s been less about programming and more about building the brand, making sure the product can keep changing and evolving over time. The service was launched February 12th 2014 at [vimla.se](https://www.vimla.se)
