### Process

The first step of our collaboration was to build the core functionality of the site - signing up, logging in and changing basic account settings. Since this was built before the brand was even decided, the look and feel was kept generic. We then collaborated with Made to Order to adapt the site to the first version of the Vimla! brand. Since then the design, products, and flow has changed several times based on the feedback from the members, changes in the market and insights from Vimla! and Iteam. In order for this process to work,  we are constantly refining and automating every step of development, testing and delivery. This means that we have been able to make releases once a week to multiple times a day. Through feature toggling, we can try out ideas in the wild instead of endlessly discussing them in meetings. And through direct interaction with the members in the Forum, we can catch and fix any bug that slips through the tests as early as possible.
