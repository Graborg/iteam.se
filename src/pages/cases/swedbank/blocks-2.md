### A clear vision

When we joined the project, everyone was hard at work building the features listed in the back-log. But no-one knew why. Our first focus was to help clarify the vision. It was decided that the goals of the project was to achieve: Superior User Experience, Excellent Market Responsiveness and Basic Functionality. Clarifying these goals made it possible to prioritize between features, focus the collaboration between the teams and to report qualitative progress to the governing committee instead of just a burn-up chart.
