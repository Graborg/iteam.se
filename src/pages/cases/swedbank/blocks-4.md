### A culture of learning

As a support and back-bone for the development of a new digital platform, extending outside of the realms of the internet bank, we helped founding the FDP Academy. This is an initiative to teach and mentor developers at Swedbank in the technology, insights and learnings of the new platform initiative. Iteam has helped form the contents of the program as well as teaching the first generations of academy students. The idea is to create a sustainable system of constant learning and improvement, where graduates become the mentors who teach the next generation.

### Swedbank

Swedbank has its roots in the Swedish savings bank movement, which dates back to 1820. Sweden’s savings banks were founded to help people achieve a higher standard of living and greater security through financial planning. Swedbank’s operations are still based on the same goal: to help the many people and businesses achieve a solid financial sustainability. Swedbank is an inclusive bank with 7,2 million private customers and more than 600 000 corporate and organisational customers.This makes Swedbank Sweden’s largest bank in terms of number of customers and gives us a leading position in our other home markets of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
