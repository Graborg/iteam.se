The new public-facing API also enables partners and third party developers to directly integrate with Taxi Stockholm’s services. Taxi Stockholm is now technically equipped to be an integrated part of the Stockholm transport eco system.

### The power of automation

For many of the customers the new mobile apps, built by partner Bontouch, with optional flat fares and the ability to pay with a pre-registered credit card (and just leave the car the second it arrives at its destination) makes the Taxi Stockholm experience easier and more streamlined than ever. Digital receipts also takes off the workload when keeping your books. For those that don’t want to use an app or have special requirements, the call center gets even more accessible as app bookings increase.

### Using the momentum

Digital transformation is a continuous process and the new API and the new apps are just the first steps in Taxi Stockholm’s journey to provide a superior digital experience. The next step in the transformation is using machine learning and big data to getting to know the customers better and anticipating their needs, providing new services and staying ahead of the competition in the local market.
