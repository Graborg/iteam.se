Iteam has helped Taxi Stockholm build a modern REST API on top of existing systems to provide a new backend for new consumer apps that will help the stay ahead of the competition. The API along with other projects to increase customer knowledge, automating agreement signups, and increasing organizational efficiency means Taxi Stockholm is now equipped to be the major player on the Stockholm taxi market digitally as well as physically.


### A strong brand with a proud history

Founded in 1899, Taxi Stockholm is Sweden’s oldest taxi company and with 22 000 rides per day it is also Stockholm’s largest. The company has a strong code of ethics and a large environmental focus. However, lately, the brand has not kept up with the competition in its digital presence.

### Digital transformation

With history comes legacy. A traffic control system originally built to provide the best service for customers calling in might not be the optimal platform to take the same experience into the digital realm. To solve this, Iteam built a modern REST API on top of existing systems to provide the new iPhone and Android apps with a powerful and reliable backend. Building the API solution top-down with customer value instead of systems in focus made the time to market as short as possible and lets the organization take care of technical debt without stress.
